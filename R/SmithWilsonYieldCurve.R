#' A package to fit yield curves using the Smith-Wilson method
#' 
#' The main function exposed in this package is fFitSmithWilsonYieldCurve, which takes market data in the form of a vector of cashflow times, a matrix of cashflows and a vector of market prices. It returns an object of class "SmithWilsonYieldCurve". 
#' 
#' A convenience function fFitSmithWilsonYieldCurveToInstruments takes a dataframe containing market instrument data as type, tenor, frequency, rate and price. It extracts the required vectors and matrices and then calls fFitSmithWilsonYieldCurve.
#' 
#' Objects of class SmithWilsonYieldCurve are a list, the first element of which is a function P(t), which returns the zero coupon bond price of the fitted curve at time t.
